<PAGE>&5&lWelcome to DwarfCraft!\n\n&0You have a set of skills that let you do certain tasks better. When you first start things may be more difficult than you're used to, but as you level your skills up you will be much more productive.</PAGE>
<PAGE>&5The Races of DwarfCraft\n\n&0There are four basic races in DwarfCraft. It is up to you to choose a race that best fits your play style. You will not be able to level any skills in DwarfCraft until you pick a race.</PAGE>
<PAGE>{\"text\":\"Read about the four races on the pages that follow, then type '/dc race' or click here to begin your journey.\",\"color\":\"dark_red\",\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\",\"value\":\"/dc race\"}}</PAGE>
<PAGE>&3The Dwarf\n\n&0The Dwarf race specializes in mining. The skills in this race will allow you to mine more efficiently, gather additional ores, and are great excavators. The Dwarf plays an important role in providing resources for tools and equipment needed by the other races. Their race relies on you providing resources. If you enjoy mining, this race would be great for you.</PAGE>
<PAGE>&9The Gnome\n\n&0The Gnome race specializes in crafting and building. They will provide structures for you, craft your tools and equipment, and are all around masters of the crafting table. If you enjoy casually and creatively building or are a  master in redstone contraptions, this race would be great for you.</PAGE>
<PAGE>&4The Elf\n\n&0The Elf race specializes in all things combat. They deal extra damage to animals and mobs and get extra drops. They are great at gaining experience levels and protecting your fellow members. They are also great archers and have great exploration skills whether it be on foot or boat.

<PAGE>&8The Human\n\n&0The Human race specializes in various support and utility skills such as smelting, cooking, fishing, and farming. They are great lumberjacks and are great for gathering wood and processing resources from the Dwarf for the Gnome and Elf. If you enjoy playing a casual support role, the Human race best fits you.</PAGE>
<PAGE>&5Skilling in DwarfCraft\n\n&0Now that you have learned about the various races to choose from and hopefully found one that fits you, it is time to learn how you can advance your character in that race. If you want to become the best of your class you will need to train by visiting trainers in the world. We will learn more about trainers in a bit. First lets talk about your skills and skillsheet.</PAGE>
<PAGE>&0At first your skills will be very poor which means you will perform tasks worse than normal gameplay. You will find your low level skills dropping less resources, crafting less items, taking longer, or requiring more tools. As you level you will begin to exceed the normal rates and excel in some tasks. Normal gameplay rates take effect around level %raceLevelLimit%. You also wont be able to excel in every skill to the highest level. The skills in which your race specializes in can be levelled to level %maxSkillLevel% while all other skills outside your race specialty will cap out at the normal rates.</PAGE>
<PAGE>[{\"text\":\"You can access your current skill levels at anytime with '/dc skillsheet'.\\n\",\"color\":\"dark_red\",\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\",\"value\":\"/dc skillsheet\"}},{\"text\":\"\\nYou can find all the skills which your character has yet to train by typing '/dc skillsheet full'.\",\"color\":\"dark_red\",\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\",\"value\":\"/dc skillsheet full\"}}]</PAGE>
<PAGE>&0Now you know that basics of how skilling works in DwarfCraft. Lets discuss the final topic in DwarfCraft, which is how you train those skills.</PAGE>
<PAGE>&5DwarfCraft Trainers\n\n&0Trainers are experts in the skill they teach. They will share their knowledge with you in return for specific resources related to that skill.</PAGE>
