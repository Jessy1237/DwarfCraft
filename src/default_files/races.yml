# DwarfCraft Race Configuration

# Races allow players to specialize in certain skills which allow them to train them past the vanilla level.
# i.e. Human's (smithing, cooking and farming), Elves (combat and hunting), Dwarves (mining and excavating)
# and Gnomes (brewery and crafting)

# Skill IDs: are the skills that the race excels in compared to other races.
# NOTE: If the race doesn't specialize in a skill then they can't train it further than the vanilla player level (Generally level 5).
# Description: is used on the Race GUI (/dc race) to explain the race to players to guide them towards choosing a race for their play style.
# Prefix Colour:  will be used to color the races prefix tag in chat to distinguish the races
# Material Icon: The ID of a block/item used to display in the Race GUI for that race

# Use the following format for defining races. If no race name, icon, or skill IDs are provided
# the race will be skipped and will not be loaded by DwarfCraft. Providing no description, an empty description will be used.
# A default prefix colour of white will be used if no prefix colour if given.
