DwarfCraft is an RPG plugin that allows players to improve their characters skills 
and capabilities in Minecraft through training not experience. DwarfCraft adds about a hundred
DwarfCraft created skills and introduces DwarfCraft Trainers that provide players with a way to train them.

## Features:
* Fully Customizable
* Players may choose to play as any race you create
    * The default races provided are Human, Gnome, Dwarf and Elf.
    * Switching races resets all skills
    * The race names are entirely configurable
* Players visit a DwarfCraft trainer to deposit items and train a skill.
    * Left-click a trainer to see what skill they will teach and what progress
      have made.
    * Right-click a trainer to deposit items or train the skill.
* Players can see their full skillsheet of all skills they have levelled and
  see their progress.

## Ways to Play:
DwarfCraft encourages players to work together and roleplay their race. A factions based server design is
highly encourage for this plugin. By default, four races are provided for players to choose. When players 
first join the Minecraft world they are asked to choose a race or given the default race if one is provided 
in the config.

Each race will specialize in a few skills and allows players to master these skills by levelling them to a much
higher level. These specializations are core to their race and will provide benefits to players of other races.
Each race is designed around a different style of play such as mining, crafting, combat, or support.

DwarfCraft modifies the vanilla experience of Minecraft to add more challenge to the early game allow players
to work together. As such players will break tools faster, take more damage, gather less resources, or craft less until
they level their skills.

## Races:

### Dwarf
#### Specializations: Mining and Excavating
The Dwarf specializes in mining. The skills in this race will allow you to mine more efficiently, 
gather additional ores, and excavate terrain. The Dwarf plays an important role in providing resources for tools and 
equipment needed by the other races. Their race relies on you providing resources. If you enjoy mining, this race would 
be great for you.

skills whether it be on foot or boat. If you enjoy combat and exploring, the elven race is all about you.
